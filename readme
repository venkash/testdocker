This python script simulates the Birthday Problem experiment. 

You can enter how many people you'd like to simulate and how many times you'd like to simulate it. 

This script also provides a percent of error based on the formula expected for the problem, found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem

8/13  Changed this script to no longer require interactive input.  Also made Python 3 compatible.  Finally, results are now output in a JSON blob.
